A React-based, fully responsive website that uses JSON data and combines creative design and space adventures.

This project was a lovely opportunity to follow a provided, structured Figma design and bring to life. It implements lazy loading and component/page animations, and is based on TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Styled Components and Framer Motion. For a detailed overview, please have a look at the [**Features**](#features) & [**Tech**](#tech) section.

**Important Note**: All of the image assets, along with the design files were provided by Frontend Mentor, as part of the _Space tourism multi-page website_ challenge.
